It will help in going back in history to see the changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
YOu don't want to commit on every file save. That will clutter the commit history.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It makes it easy to track file changes per feature.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
First use git log to find the commit that you are looking for. Then use git diff <that commit id> <previoud commit id which is below in the log>. The ones in green + are addition and the ones in red - are deletion.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It lets you go back to any of the pevious commits which is helpful in adding changes freely.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Use git-hub
