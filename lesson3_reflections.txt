When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. When we don't want to loose all our changes in case something wrong happens to our local machine.
2. When we want to share code between different people.
3. When we want to share our code with others easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I don't want random merging in the middle of my work. Rather I would like to pull only when I am ready to merge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: copies one repository to another remote repository. used when we want to get someone else's repository to wok with.
clones: copies a remote repository to local repository. used when we want to work on a remote repository locally.
branches: copies a local repository to another branches. Used when we want to have different version of our work.
